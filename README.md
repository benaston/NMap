NMap
====

A library to simplify type creation and mapping whilst maintaining loose coupling.

Example of use:

```C#


	var complexObject = new ObjectCreator().CreateFrom<SimpleObject, IComplexObject, ComplexObject>(simpleObject, factory);


```

If NMap helps you or your team develop great software please [let me know](mailto:ben@bj.ma "Ben's email address")! It will help motivate me to develop and improve NMap.


How to use:
--------
**-1. Check the target framework of your application**

It *must* be ```.NET Framework 4``` (*not* the ```Client Profile``` version - or you might get strange compilation errors.)


**0. Get it**

```shell
	nuget install nfeature
```


**1. Define some features**

In your code:

```C#

	
	public enum Feature
	{
		MyFeature,
		MyOtherFeature,
		MyOtherOtherFeature,
	}
		

```

In your configuration: (see also footnote 1)

*NOTE: remember to replace ```Your.Feature.Type``` and ```Your.Feature.Type.Assembly``` in the text below.*

```XML
	...
  	<configSections>
		...
		<!-- note that if you are using your own tenant enum then you will have 
		to replace "Your.Feature.Type, Your.Feature.Type.Assembly"
		with your type -->
		<section name="features" type="NFeature.Configuration.FeatureConfigurationSection`1[[Your.Feature.Type, Your.Feature.Type.Assembly]], NFeature.Configuration" />
		...
	</configSections>
	
	<features>
		<add name="MyFeature" state="Enabled" /> 
		<add name="MyOtherFeature" state="Previewable" /> <!-- will only be available to users who meet the feature-preview criteria -->
		<add name="MyOtherOtherFeature" state="Disabled" /> 
	</features>
	...
	
```

**2. Define the availability-checking function**


```C#


	//Here is a function that will only return 'true' if the feature is MyFeature.
	//Your function might be more elaborate. For example: feature availability might 
	//depend upon site load, user role or presence of a cookie.
	Func<FeatureSetting<Feature, DefaultTenantEnum>, EmptyArgs, bool> fn = (f, args) => f.Feature == Feature.MyFeature;

```

**3. Take care of feature manifest initialization**

*For a working example of this see the integration test named ```FeatureEnumExtensionsTests``` in the ```NFeature.Test.Slow``` project, within the main solution.*

```C#


	//NOTE: I suggest hiding this ugly initialization logic away in the IOC container configuration	
	var featureSettingRepo = new AppConfigFeatureSettingRepository<Feature>();
	var availabilityChecker = new FeatureSettingAvailabilityChecker<Feature>(fn); //from step 2
	var featureSettingService = new FeatureSettingService<Feature>(availabilityChecker, featureSettingRepo);
	var manifestCreationStrategy = new NFeature.DefaultImplementations.ManifestCreationStrategyDefault<Feature>(featureSettingRepo, featureSettingService); //we use the default for this example
	var featureManifestService = new FeatureManifestService<Feature>(manifestCreationStrategy);
	var featureManifest = featureManifestService.GetManifest();


```


**4. Configure feature dependencies (if there are any)**

```XML

	
    <features>
		<add name="MyFeature" dependencies="MyOtherFeature,MyOtherOtherFeature" />
	</features>

```


**5. Add code that is conditional on feature availability**
	
```C#


	if(Feature.MyFeature.IsAvailable(featureManifest)) //featureManifest ideally supplied via IOC container
	{
		//do some cool stuff
	}
	
```


**6. Optionally configure feature-specific settings using Json (neatly side-stepping the need for angle brackets)**

*Arbitrary JSON is supported through the use of ```dynamic``` objects.*

```XML

	
	<features>
		<add name="MyFeature" settings="{ mySetting:'mySettingValue', 
				   	                      myOtherSetting:['myOtherSettingValue','myOtherOtherSettingValue'] }" />
	</features>

```

**7. Optionally specify dates for feature availability**

```XML

	
    <features>
		<add name="MyFeature" startDtg="23/03/2012:00:00:00" /> <!-- available from 23rd March 2012 forever -->
		<add name="MyOtherFeature" startDtg="23/03/2012:00:00:00" endDtg="24/03/2012:00:00:00" /> <!-- available from 23rd March 2012 until the 24th -->
		<add name="MyOtherOtherFeature" endDtg="24/03/2012:00:00:00" /> <!-- available until 24th March 2012 -->
	</features>

```

**8. At some future date... optionally mark your feature as ```Established``` to indicate that it is now integral to your application and cannot be turned off (see footnote 2)**

*Any availability checks for ```Established``` features will throw an exception, forcing their removal (as is good practice.)*

```XML

	
	<features>
		<add name="MyFeature" state="Established" />
	</features>

```

**9. ...**

**10. Profit!**


How to build and/or run the tests:
--------

1. Run `/build/build.bat`
1. Type in the desired option
1. Hit return



**Footnote 1:**
Please note that the logic to determine whether a feature is available is specified in the ```IFeatureManifestCreationStrategy``` instance you inject into the ```FeatureManifestService``` and (optionally, depending on your implementation of the aforementioned strategy) by the availability-checking function you inject into the ```FeatureSettingAvailabilityChecker```. 

Two concrete implementations of ```IFeatureManifestCreationStrategy``` are provided of-the-box: ```ManifestCreationStrategyDefault``` and ```ManifestCreationStrategyConsideringStateCookieTenantAndTime```. A single default availability checker function is provided out of the box ```DefaultFunctions.AvailabilityCheckFunction```, which may be used when the feature state, tenant, feature visibility mode and system time are known.

**Footnote 2:**
Marking a feature as established changes the behavior of the feature in the following way:

 - all dependencies must be established
 - checking the feature's availability will throw an exception (because it is now always available by definition)


**NOTE: this is pre-release quality software. There will be bugs/inaccuracies in the documentation. If you find an issue, please help me by adding an issue here on GitHub.**
